      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hello, I'm huge nerd (usually more D&D and fantasy but I'm looking to expand into computers) and former barista.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I'm local I've been in Colorado my whole life generally in or around Thornto.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I already said the fantasy nerd thing yeah? My favorite past time tends to be running a D&D game with friends or just having a board game night in general.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Honestly, I don't know I'm learning coding and so far it's fun but I don't know where it'll take me. Let's just see what part I enjoy the most. To be honest I'm more of a work to live person.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I'm happy here in Colorado I'm if push comes to shove there are reasons I'd leave the state but nothing comes to mind at the moment.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>It's a new skill and it's in demand what's not to like? That's not even mentioning that it's in line with the direction the future is going.</p>
